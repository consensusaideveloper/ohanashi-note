# Test

Run all tests and fix any failures.

## Steps

1. Run `cd app && npm run test`
2. If any tests fail:
   - Read the failure output carefully
   - Determine whether the test or the source code needs fixing
   - Fix the issue
   - Re-run `cd app && npm run test`
3. Repeat until all tests pass
4. Report the final test results (number of tests, pass/fail)
