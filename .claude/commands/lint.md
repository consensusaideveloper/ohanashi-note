# Lint

Run ESLint and fix any linting errors.

## Steps

1. Run `cd app && npm run lint`
2. If there are errors or warnings:
   - Read each error message and the file/line reference
   - Fix each issue in the source files
   - Re-run `cd app && npm run lint`
3. Repeat until there are zero errors and zero warnings
4. Report the final lint status
